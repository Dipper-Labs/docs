# How to run a validator

## 1. Install and deploy a full node

Please follow the [tutorial](./how-to-join-testnet.md) to deploy the full node of the testnet and ensure that it is synchronized to the latest block height.

## 2. Set the environment

```bash
dipcli config chain-id dip-testnet
dipcli config output json
dipcli config indent true
dipcli config trust-node true
```

## 3.Create an account

```bash
# The content in the example <> needs to be replaced according to the situation.

dipcli keys add <key_name>
# Enter the password for the encrypted account as prompted (required for subsequent transactions), and carefully save the information returned by the command
```

## 4. Obtain test Token

To get the test token, please refer to [here](./testcoin.md)

## 5. Create a validator

```bash
dipcli tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=10000000000pdip \
  --pubkey=$(dipd tendermint show-validator -o text) \
  --moniker=<validator_name> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="100" \
  --from=$(dipcli keys show -a <key_name>) \
  --ip=<node_public_ip> \
  --node-id=<node ID> \
  --gas=200000

 e.g
dipcli tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=10000000000pdip \
  --pubkey=$(dipd tendermint show-validator -o text) \
  --moniker=DipperNetwork \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="100" \
  --from=DipperNetwork \
  --ip=xx.xx.xx.xx \
  --gas=200000
  
```


<font color=red>Tipsï¼š</font>```--node-id``` and ```--ip``` are optional.
```ip``` is the public ip of the node. ```node-ids``` can be acquired via command ```dipd tendermint show-node-id```. If you enter these 2 parameters, you node will be a public seed blockchain node.

## 6. Query validators

```bash
dipcli query staking validators

# You can find the newly added validator lucy in the list

[
  {
    "operator_address": "dipvaloper18q4pv9qvmqx7dcd2jq3dl3d0755urk8300709e",
    "consensus_pubkey": "dipvalconspub1zcjduepqua3tt6kl7v7sd558m24fj3s039fhmsxcv9fc49rqn0uwcuelvrmsdp3hwt",
    "jailed": false,
    "status": 0,
    "tokens": "10000",
    "delegator_shares": "10000.000000000000000000",
    "description": {
      "moniker": "lucy",
      "identity": "",
      "website": "",
      "details": ""
    },
    "unbonding_height": "0",
    "unbonding_time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "commission": {
      "commission_rates": {
        "rate": "0.100000000000000000",
        "max_rate": "0.200000000000000000",
        "max_change_rate": "0.010000000000000000"
      },
      "update_time": "2019-10-30T11:21:01.013731989Z"
    },
    "min_self_delegation": "100",
    "self_delegation": "10000.000000000000000000"
  }
]

```

## 7. Let the validator just create block

Step5 creates a validator, and its status is 0 at this time, 0 means that it has not been bound because there is not enough pdip to mortgage;

1000000000000pdip is a voting power, and the minimum unit of voting power is 1. Only when it is> = 1 can it become the binding state 2 and become an active validator to produce blocks.

Therefore, at least 990000pdip needs to be mortgaged. You can use your own account to collateral yourself, or you can let other accounts collateral to your verifier. Here are shown separately:

Here you need to use the validator address corresponding to the lucy account in step 4. operator_address: dipvaloper18q4pv9qvmqx7dcd2jq3dl3d0755urk8300709e

### Delegate 990000pdip

```bash
dipcli tx staking delegate <address-validator-operator> 990000pdip --from=<key name>

e.g.:
dipcli tx staking delegate dipvaloper18q4pv9qvmqx7dcd2jq3dl3d0755urk8300709e 990000pdip --from=$(dipcli keys show -a <key name>) --gas=200000 --gas-prices=1000.0pdip
```

## 8. Confirm the validator status

```bash
dipcli query staking validators

[
  {
    "operator_address": "dipvaloper18q4pv9qvmqx7dcd2jq3dl3d0755urk8300709e",

    "self_delegation": "1000000.000000000000000000"
  }
]

# You can see that the status of the newly added validator lucy becomes 2, an active validator, you can check the block status through the block browser
```
## 9. How to unbond DIP
To withdraw bonded staking you delegated for a validator by executing the following command ```unband```.

```bash
dipcli tx staking unbond <validator-addr> <amountToUnbond> --from <mykey> --gas <gasPrice> --gas-prices <gasPrice>

e.g.
dipcli tx staking unbond dipvaloper1gghjut3ccd8ay0zduzj64hwre2fxs9ldmqhffj 10000000000000pdip --from DipperNetwork --gas=200000 --gas-prices=1000.0pdip
```

<font color=red>Warning</font>

 Be carefully,```validator-addr```is ```operator_address``` of the Validator.

## 10. About validator rewards and punishments

Validators will receive corresponding proportion of reward If they are long-term online and paticipate consensus of network.

The number of rewards is depending on the annual inflation of network and the ratio of Staking on the network.

In response to the abnormal behavior of active validators, the blockchain network will set them to jail states and slash a certain percentage of the bonded DIP. There are two main types of abnormal behavior:


#### 1. Long-term offline or not participate the consensus 

If the ratio of missed blocks of a validator during a specific duration of ```signed_blocks_window```. The network will slash a ratio of DIP which the validator staked according to ```slash_fraction_downtime```, then the validator will be jailed. The validator can be unjailed by executing command ``` unjail``` after the duration of ```downtime_jail_duration```.

The following are default parameters:

```javascript
signed_blocks_window: 10000
min_signed_per_window: 50%
slash_fraction_downtime: 0.05%
downtime_jail_duration: 2days
```

#### 2. Malacious sign (AKA double sign) 

A validator initiates contradictory vote during the consensus process. That is, the validator signs different blocks in the same round with the same height.

The default parameter of double sign punishment:

```javascript
slash_fraction_double_sign:0.5 %
```
